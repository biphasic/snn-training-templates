    "When training a spiking neural network (SNN), one might think about how the learning rate or model size affect training time. But when it comes to training *faster*, optimizing data movement is crucial. 3 out of the first 4 points in [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kvs1ex/d_here_are_17_ways_of_making_pytorch_training/) weighted after potential speed-up have to do with how data is shaped and moved around between actual computations. It makes a huge difference, because training faster means getting results faster!\n",

    "For this post we train an SNN on the [Heidelberg Spiking Speech Commands](https://zenkelab.org/resources/spiking-heidelberg-datasets-shd/) dataset to do audio stream classification. We'll benchmark different data loading strategies using [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and show that with the right strategy, we can achieve a more than 10-fold speed-up compared to the naïve approach.\n",

    "All data from neuromorphic datasets in Tonic is provided as NxD numpy arrays. We'll need to transform this into a dense tensor to serve it to the GPU, and we'll also do some downsampling of time steps. Let's first define the transform. We know that samples of audio input data in this dataset are 0.8-1.2s long across 700 frequency channels at microsecond resolution. We'll [downsample](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/tonic.transforms.Downsample.html#tonic.transforms.Downsample) each sample to 100 channels, [bin](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/tonic.transforms.ToFrame.html#tonic.transforms.ToFrame) events every 4 ms to one frame and [cut](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/tonic.transforms.CropTime.html#tonic.transforms.CropTime) samples that are longer than 1s.

Now we're going to cache, which means save, those transformed samples to disk during the first epoch, so that we don't need to recompute them later on! To do this we simply wrap our previous dataset in a [DiskCachedDataset](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/data_classes.html#tonic.DiskCachedDataset) and provide the cache path. When a new sample is about to be loaded, that class will first check if the transformed sample is already in the cache on disk and if it isn't, it will retrieve the original sample, apply the transform, cache it to disk and then serve it. This caching process slows down training in the first epoch, but it pays off afterwards!\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The principle of caching can be applied to any data that you apply deterministic transformations to, but it pays off particularly well for event-based data. By using cached samples and not having to recompute the same transformations every time, we save ourselves a lot of time during training. If the data already sits on the GPU when it is requested, the speedup is really high. After all, there is a reason why neural network accelerators heavily optimise memory caching to minimise time and energy spent on data movement. So when should you use either disk- or GPU-caching?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Disk-caching**: Broadly applicable, useful if you apply deterministic transformations to each sample and you train for many epochs. Not ideal if you're low on disk space.\n",
    "* **GPU-caching**: Only really suitable for small datasets and a bit more intricate to setup, but well worth the effort if you want to explore many different architectures / training parameters due to the speed of iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last note, you might be wondering why we don't cache to the host memory instead of reading from a disk cache. This is totally possible, but the bottleneck at that point really is moving the data onto the GPU, which takes time. Whether the data sits in host memory or is loaded from disk using multiple worker threads doesn't make much of a difference, because the GPU cannot handle the data movement. Since on disk we have much more space available than in RAM, we normally choose to do that.\n",
